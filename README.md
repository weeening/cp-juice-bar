# cp-juice-bar
My very first program/system for TCP 1121 Computer Programming! This is a juice bar order management system (lol) written in c++.

Disclaimer: 
1. This was the very first project I did as an IT student with no programming background whatsoever back then. 
2. IRL this is abit cringy and won't work but its a good way to see how programming works. 
3. Like an example for people who has never done programming before?
